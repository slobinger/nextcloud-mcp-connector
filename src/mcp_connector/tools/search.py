"""Cloud wide search over every installed search provider (D-08, TOOL-06).

The permission check is not ours. Nextcloud runs each provider in the context of the
authenticated user and returns only what that user may see, which is why this tool keeps
no index and caches nothing (threat T-01-70). Our job is the fan-out and the honesty.

Four properties are contract, not implementation detail.

**The provider list is read at runtime.** It depends on the installed apps, so hardcoding
it would either miss an app or invent one. It is fetched per call, without a cache: an app
enabled a minute ago must be searchable without restarting this server.

**The fan-out is parallel and bounded.** ``asyncio.gather(return_exceptions=True)`` plus a
hard timeout per provider means one stalling app costs seconds, not the whole answer
(threat T-01-71). Every provider that fails or stalls appears under ``degraded`` with its
name and a reason, so a partial answer is always labelled as one.

**Every hit carries an id or admits that it does not.** Files hits become ``file:<id>``,
notes ``note:<id>``, deck cards the short ``card:<cardId>`` form, and everything else
``url:<absolute-url>``. The last two are marked ``resolvable: false``, because neither can
be handed to a read tool as it stands (pitfall 10).

**The expectation is managed in the answer.** ``note`` says out loud what this answer
matched: names and metadata only, or file contents too, when a content provider such as
findling answered (BL-15). Without it a model concludes "the document does not exist"
from a search that never looked inside a single file, or distrusts a real content hit
because the payload claims contents are not indexed (pitfall 5, both directions).

**A hit that carries a file passes the sandbox and the tag (EXCL-03, SBX-01).** Every
provider counts, not only files: Findling, comments and notes hits name their file by id
only, so that id is resolved into a path when the sandbox or a tagged folder needs it
(:func:`_screen`). A sandbox drop is counted in ``skipped``; a ``kein-ki`` drop leaves no
trace at all. When the exclusion check cannot be answered, every file-bearing hit is held
back and ``degraded`` names that once.
