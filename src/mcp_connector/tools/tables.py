"""Tables tools: one browse tool with a level, and one create-only write (D-06, D-14).

**One tool, three levels.** ``tables_browse(level=...)`` walks the tables, the columns of a
table and its rows. Three separate tools would cost three slots in every client that limits
them and three schemas in every ``tools/list``, for navigation the model can express in one
enum value. The answer envelope is the same on every level (``level``, ``count``,
``results``), so the model learns one shape instead of three.

**The limit is enforced, not offered.** A row read without a limit returns *every* row of
the table, so a table with 20.000 rows would become one MCP answer (pitfall 1). The default
is :data:`DEFAULT_LIMIT` rows, the ceiling is :data:`MAX_LIMIT`, and a table that has more
rows than the window says so in the answer: ``rowsCount`` next to ``count`` and ``offset``,
plus ``truncated`` and a ``next`` handle. ``rowsCount`` is left out instead of invented when
the app reports none, and a window that came back full is then the evidence that there is
more. Truncation is named here, never silent.

**Two things are explained before they can fail.** A missing or disabled Tables app stops
both tools at the capabilities check, before the first Tables request (SRV-04). And a user
without a write permission on a shared table is refused by this tool with a sentence and a
next step, instead of being walked into a 403 out of Nextcloud's permission middleware. The
middleware stays the authority; the pre-check is only the better error message.

Deliberately absent: update, delete, creating columns or whole tables, importing a scheme
and every share path. The client below has no code for any of it, which is what makes the
create-only annotation of ``tables_create_row`` honest rather than a promise (T-08-11).

**A link cell is a stored copy of a file (D-28-14).** A Tables link column that points at a
Nextcloud file keeps the file name and the file id in the cell itself, so a row read would
name a file tagged ``kein-ki`` without ever touching the file. :func:`screen_links` runs once
per call before any cell is projected, in ``tables_browse`` and in ``fetch(table:)`` alike,
and a cell of a tagged file answers exactly like an empty link cell.
