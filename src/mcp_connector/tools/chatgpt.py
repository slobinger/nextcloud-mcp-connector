"""The ChatGPT compatibility profile: ``search`` and ``fetch`` (D-09, TOOL-07).

Two functions, and both of them are deliberately thin.

**``search`` owns no search.** It calls :func:`mcp_connector.tools.search.unified_search`
and renames its fields. A second hit source here would mean two answers to the same
question, two id schemes and two places to fix pitfall 10, so the only logic in it is the
projection onto the four names OpenAI reads.

**Every hit keeps a link.** ChatGPT renders a citation only while ``url`` is a non-empty
string, so an empty one does not degrade a hit, it removes it from the answer the user
sees. The unified search already guarantees an absolute URL on the configured instance;
the fallbacks below exist so a future provider cannot quietly take the citations away.

**``fetch`` owns no reader.** It parses the id once, through the central codec, and then
calls the tool that already knows how to read that kind. Seven properties of that routing
are load bearing:

* A prefix is never guessed. An unknown one is refused with the list of the valid ones,
  because resolving a Talk message as a note is worse than any error (threat T-01-77).
* A ``url`` id is answered, not fetched. This server never requests a URL that came out of
  a search entry; that is the SSRF door and it stays shut (threat T-01-75).
* The Deck short form is resolved by a sweep over the boards and their stacks, one request
  per board. Deck's internal single card route would be one request instead, but it is
  undocumented and unverified (assumption A4), so it is not used here at all. A unit test
  greps this file for it, which is why it is described rather than spelled out.
* The sweep cache lives inside one call and nowhere else (D-20). A module level cache would
  hand the board list of one user to the next request of another.
* A mail is read as text and as data at the same time. The body is converted, cut at a
  ceiling of its own and marked where it was cut; what Nextcloud believes about the sender
  travels beside that text in ``metadata`` and never inside it, because next to foreign
  content a sentence of this server is indistinguishable from a sentence of the sender
  (threat T-10-28).
* One Talk message is answered by exactly that message or by a sentence. The context route
  hands over a window, so the wanted id is filtered out of it and a missing one is refused;
  answering with the message next to it would be wrong in a way nobody can see (T-11-13). The
  token of that conversation is resolved through the account's own list, so an address out of
  a model answer never reaches the instance in a path (T-11-14).
* A table is answered as an excerpt that says how big the table is: title, row count, the
  first :data:`TABLE_ROWS` rows, cut at :data:`MAX_TABLE_BYTES`. ``tables_browse`` is the way
  to the rest, and a table without a row is a sentence rather than a title on its own.

**No text of an answer carries a marker this server did not write.** ``text`` is one field
for every kind, so the truncation note of a cut file and the content of a note, a card, a
mail, a chat message or a table cell land in the same place a model reads. Every one of the
seven readers therefore filters the marker sequences out of the foreign text
(:mod:`mcp_connector.tools.marks`), and only the file, the mail and the table reader write one
back in, where a text actually ended; a cut chat message says so beside its text instead,
because phase 9 put no marker into a text every participant of a conversation may write. The
rule sits on all seven and not only on the three that append, because a note that forges the
sequence frames itself exactly the same way (BL-09, ME-03), and a mail is the cheapest place
of all to try it: anybody may write one.

TRUNCATION_NOTE = marks.TRUNCATION_NOTE

#: The marker for a cut with nothing behind it, re-exported the same way and from the same
#: module. It is the one a fetched mail carries, because the two others would both lie there:
#: one sends a model to ``files_read`` with an offset a message does not have, the other to
#: ``fetch``, which is the very call that just did the cutting.
FINAL_TRUNCATION = marks.FINAL_TRUNCATION

#: Ceiling for the text of one fetched mail, in bytes of the UTF-8 encoding. Measured in plan
#: 10-01 against Mail 5.11.1 on a live instance: an ordinary 45 KB newsletter arrives as 48811
#: bytes of HTML and becomes 25582 bytes of text after the conversion, so a ceiling of 16 KiB
#: would have cut the normal case. It is deliberately not :data:`MAX_TEXT_BYTES`, because 512
#: KiB of one mail is a context write-off, and just as deliberately not the preview cap of
#: ``mail_browse``, because 400 bytes is half a sentence and not a letter. The number is the
#: smaller half of this decision. The larger half is that every cut is marked and that the
#: marking says something true (threat T-10-32).
MAX_MAIL_BYTES = 32 * 1024

#: The window the context route of Talk is asked for, in messages. One is the smallest window
#: that is guaranteed to carry the wanted message: spreed lifts the history half to
#: ``max(1, limit)`` and fetches it with ``includeLastKnown = true``, then hands the same number
#: to the newer half, so this reads the wanted message plus at most one message after it
#: (measured out of the source of spreed 24.0.4 in plan 11-02). A larger window would cost
#: payload and change nothing about the certainty, because the selection happens here.
MESSAGE_CONTEXT_LIMIT = 1

#: How many rows of a table a fetch hands over. The number 20 is a setting and not a
#: measurement, in the same sense as ``talk.MAX_MESSAGE_BYTES``: a table has no natural
#: excerpt, so somebody has to decide what "the first rows" means. Twenty is a screen of rows,
#: it is below the default window of ``tables_browse`` (25) on purpose, because this answer is
#: an excerpt beside a total and not a page of a walk, and the total beside it is what keeps
#: the excerpt honest. ``tables_browse`` is the way to the rest, and it pages.
TABLE_ROWS = 20

#: Ceiling for the text of one fetched table, in bytes of the UTF-8 encoding. Also a setting:
#: :data:`TABLE_ROWS` bounds the number of rows, and this one bounds what those rows may cost,
#: because a single cell of a text column carries up to 40.000 characters and twenty of them
#: would be one megabyte. Four KiB is roughly twenty rows of eight columns of twenty
#: characters, so the ordinary table arrives whole and the pathological wide one is cut. It is
#: deliberately an eighth of :data:`MAX_MAIL_BYTES`: a letter is meant to be read from
#: beginning to end, a table excerpt is meant to say what is in the table.
MAX_TABLE_BYTES = 4 * 1024

#: to the app, because it opens an error page instead of a mail. Like every other link of this
#: module it is built from ``creds.base_url`` and never taken out of an answer: a message
#: carries several addresses that its sender chose, and this server neither requests one of
#: them nor hands one on as the link of a result (threat T-10-30).

    the link of the answer are made of. The price is one additional request per ``fetch``, and
    it is the price the whole Talk family pays: ``talk_browse`` reads the same list before it
    reads a history.
