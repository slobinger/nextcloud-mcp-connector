"""Unified search entries to prefixed ids: the table and the parsing behind pitfall 10.

A unified search entry has **no** ``id`` field. ``CoreUnifiedSearchResultEntry`` carries
``title``, ``subline``, ``resourceUrl``, ``icon``, ``rounded`` and ``attributes``, and only
the files provider fills ``attributes`` with ``fileId`` and ``path``. The notes provider
ships the note id exclusively inside ``resourceUrl``, and the Deck provider is not called
``deck`` but ``search-deck-card-board`` and delivers only the ``cardId``, never board and
stack. Everything in this module follows from those four facts.

Two rules make the ids trustworthy instead of merely present:

**Never guess a kind.** A provider that is not in :data:`PROVIDER_KINDS` produces an id of
kind ``url``, and ``fetch`` answers that honestly with "open the url" instead of resolving
a Talk message as a note (threat T-01-69). The same applies inside a known provider: a
notes entry whose URL has no numeric last segment also becomes a ``url``, because a wrong
note id silently reads a different note.

**Never keep a foreign origin.** ``resourceUrl`` comes from an arbitrary installed app and
is only ever parsed, never fetched. Every URL this module returns is rebuilt from the
configured base URL, so a manipulated entry cannot point the user (or ChatGPT's citation
renderer) at another host (threat T-01-68).

The calendar provider is deliberately **not** in the table. Its entry URL addresses a day
view, not the DAV object name that ``event:<calendarUri>:<objectName>`` needs, so it would
be an id that no ``fetch`` can resolve. It stays in the ``url`` category until a real
instance shows a resolvable form.

A tables hit on a **view** stays in the ``url`` category for the same reason, and it is the
sharper case, because the two links are indistinguishable at a glance: the tables app builds
``#/table/<id>`` and ``#/view/<id>`` from one template, and the client of this project reads
tables only (``get_table``, ``get_columns`` and ``get_rows_simple`` all build a
``tables/{id}`` path). A view id passed off as a table id therefore does not fail loudly, it
reads the table that happens to carry that number (threat T-11-01), which is why
:func:`_tables_node` reads the node type together with the id and accepts only ``table``.

A **mail** hit stays ``url`` on purpose, and the reason is worth naming: ``mail:<databaseId>``
needs the database id of one message, the search entry carries a deep link into a mailbox and
a thread instead, and resolving that link to a database id is unmeasured and an explicit
future requirement. A guessed database id would not answer with an error, it would read
somebody else's mail (threat T-11-05).

``talk-conversations`` is not in the table either: a conversation is not a document, and
``talk_browse`` is the way to it.
