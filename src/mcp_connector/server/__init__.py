"""MCP server layer: the only place in this project that registers tools.

Three things live here and nowhere else: the server object with its tool annotations, the
compact JSON serialisation, and the graceful wrapper that turns every internal error into
one honest sentence for the model. Transport arguments are not part of the constructor;
``entry_stdio`` calls ``mcp.run()`` and ``entry_http`` builds ``streamable_http_app()``.

The auth wiring is decided once, at process start, from the environment: either the SDK
bearer layer guards the server (static bearer, single-user deployment) or it stays
completely unarmed and the Basic credentials of each request are passed through. Mixing
the two is pitfall 2, and switching modes is a restart, not a request.

Deliberately absent (D-19, D-20, pitfall 1): the v1 server class, the legacy-only
statelessness switch and ``request_state_security``. In mcp 2.x both protocol eras are
served from one server object, and that switch only affects the legacy leg, where it costs
both server-to-client channels. It is the exact setting behind nextcloud/context_agent#227,
so it stays unset and is not even named here, which keeps the grep gate honest.

    ``from None`` is not cosmetic: an httpx traceback can contain the request URL, and a
    URL is one careless change away from carrying credentials (threat T-01-07). A 4xx or a
    guard rejection reaches the model as text so it can correct itself; only situations no
    model could fix (missing credentials in HTTP mode) become an ``MCPError``, which plan
    04 adds where it belongs.

    Generic in the return type, because thirteen tools answer with a compact JSON string
    and the two tools of the ChatGPT profile answer with a Pydantic model. Pinning this to
    ``str`` would erase exactly the annotation the SDK builds their output schema from.

    This is also the one place a tool call is recorded (D-04), because it is the one place
    that already sees every one of them together with its outcome. What goes into a row is
    the user, the tool, the moment, the calling client, one of the three outcome classes,
    the duration and the *names* of the parameters that were set: never a value, never a
    piece of the answer, and of a refusal only the fixed identifier, never the sentence
    above (T-18-01).

    Two properties of the ``finally`` branch are load bearing. The write is awaited and not
    handed to ``asyncio.create_task``: a detached task has no defined order against the
    answer it describes and would swallow its own exception, which is precisely what D-13
    forbids. And ``record.note`` never raises, which is what keeps the branch honest: an
    ``await`` in a ``finally`` that raises would replace the exception on its way out with
    its own (T-18-17).
