"""The exclusion guard core: is anything tagged ``kein-ki``, and if so, what (EXCL-02, EXCL-04).

This module turns the two calls of ``clients.systemtags`` into one value, a :class:`TagScope`,
and holds the policy the client deliberately does not know. It withholds nothing itself and
shapes no message; the tool layer of phase 27 does that with the value it gets from here.

Why three states and not a boolean (EXCL-04): "nothing is tagged" and "the question could not
be answered" must never collapse into the same value. ``untagged`` leaves every answer exactly
as it was, ``active`` carries the tagged set, and ``unverifiable`` carries a reason code and
refuses to be read as "allowed": :meth:`TagScope.excludes` raises in that state, so a caller
cannot filter with it by accident.

Why the REPORT outcome decides and not the ``systemtags`` capability (D-25-05): on Nextcloud
32 to 34 the capability is cached in APCu and wrong in both directions for a while after the
app is switched. The answer to the question itself is the only one that counts: 207 is a set,
412 means the id went stale and is looked up exactly once more, everything else is
``unverifiable``.

Why the tagged set is never cached beyond one call and only name to id is (E3, EXCL-02): a
tag added a second ago has to take effect on the next call, so the set is asked for anew by
every guard instance, and a guard lives exactly as long as one tool call. What survives is the
mapping from the tag name to its ids, per ``(base_url, user)``, positive results only: an
account without the tag lists again on every call, so a freshly created tag is never hidden
behind a cached "nothing". The key carries the user because visibility differs: an admin sees
restricted and invisible tags that alice does not, and an admin id handed to alice would only
ever answer 412.

Why one REPORT per spelling: Nextcloud intersects several ``oc:systemtag`` rules in one REPORT
(``array_uintersect``), so two ids in one body ask for "carries both", which silently answers
"nothing" for a node carrying only one of them. Each distinct exact spelling of the name
therefore gets its own REPORT with exactly one id, and the sets are united.

How to read success criterion 2 ("exactly one REPORT per tool call"): per tool call, that is
per guard instance, there is exactly one flight however many parts ask concurrently. Within
it one REPORT goes out per distinct spelling, which on any Nextcloud from 32 on is one unless
old duplicates exist, none goes out when nothing is tagged, plus at most the one re-listing
after a 412.

Known limit: on SQLite with about 140k tag assignments the REPORT takes longer than
``TAG_BUDGET``, so the guard is ``unverifiable`` there by construction (documented in phase 29).

What this module does not have, on purpose: no admin switch and no second path list (D-26-01,
D-26-02), and no configurable tag name. The name is ``kein-ki``, compared case-insensitively
after trimming blanks, and nothing else.
