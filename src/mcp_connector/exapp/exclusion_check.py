"""The handler behind ``occ mcp_connector:exclusion:check``: does kein-ki work here (OPS-01)?

The verdict lives in ``nextcloud/exclusion_audit.py`` and answers in data, the reads live in
``nextcloud/clients/systemtags.py`` and know no policy; this module fetches, hands the facts
to the verdict and turns the answer into sentences for a console. The same split
``exapp/exchange_check.py`` has with ``oauth/exchange_dryrun.py``, and this file is a
structural copy of that one, not an abstraction over both: a change made for one command
must not silently change how another one reads its input. The test file holds the copied
spellings against ``exapp/audit_verify.py``.

**Why there is no route in the manifest** (``exapp/audit_verify.py:13-23``). AppAPI reaches
this handler over ``PublicFunctions``, the internal path every occ handler of this app
arrives on, so it needs no declaration. A declaration would make it callable by anyone who
can reach the PHP proxy, which attaches valid AppAPI headers itself; what would leak is an
oracle over tag names and delegation groups of the instance (T-29-12). A request carrying
``x-origin-ip`` is therefore 404, a request without valid AppAPI headers 401.

**Why the answer is always 200** (``exapp/audit_verify.py:25-33``). AppAPI writes the body of
an occ handler to the console only after a status check, and on any status but 200 it
prints ``command executeHandler failed`` and drops the body unread. A failed check reported
with an error status would lose exactly the answer that names what failed. The price is
named rather than hidden: the exit code is always 0, so a script reads the ``passed`` key of
``--json`` and never the return value.

**Who the reads run as.** With ``--admin=<uid>`` the handler first proves that this account
is an administrator (``systemtags.confirm_admin``, decision b of plan 29-01) and only then
asks for ``oc:groups``, because a non-admin asking for it gets a 403 for the whole listing.
An account that is proven not to be an administrator ends the run (``passed`` false); an
answer that decides nothing leads onto the way without an administrator's view, read as the
named account, so a missing tag stays a hint there as well (D-29-03). Without ``--admin`` the
reads run as the first account (sorted) of the AppAPI user list that answers the listing
with 207, at most five tries, and only visible tags count (ENTSCHEID ohne-admin, 29-01).
Disabled accounts answer 207 too (M1c); that does no harm, since the counts are instance
wide and not filtered by the reader.

**What this module never writes down.** No object id, no path, no account: not the uid
handed to ``--admin``, not the account read as without it, not the AppAPI token that carries
either (D-29-02, D-29-10, T-29-14). The uid travels only inside that token and never in a
URL. Tag names and group ids are the answer and appear; nothing else does. Only PROPFIND
and GET leave this handler, and it writes no audit entry: it reads configuration, not data
of a user.
