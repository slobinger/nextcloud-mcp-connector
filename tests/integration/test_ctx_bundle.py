"""CTX-01 and CTX-02, measured: four legs, their wall clock, their requests, no side effect.

``TALK_BUDGET``, ``MAIL_BUDGET`` and ``MAX_MAIL_ACCOUNTS`` came out of plans 11-04 and 11-05 as
settings, said out loud as settings in their own comments. A setting is a number nobody has
weighed: too small means degradation in the healthy case, too large means a wall clock a client
gives up on. This file weighs them, and it is the only place in the repository where the four
legs of ``prepare_context`` run against a real Nextcloud at once.

Four things are load bearing in here, and the first two are the reason it exists.

**The measurement never uses the route it measures.** ``unread`` and ``unread_mention`` of the
target conversation are read through ``talk_browse(level="conversations")``, before and after
``fetch("message:...")``, and never through the context route that ``fetch`` walks. The rule
comes from plan 10-08: an operation cannot testify about itself, and a read marker moved by the
very call under test would be invisible to a measurement taken with that call. The freedom from
side effects of that route is a property of spreed 24.0.4 (``waitForNewMessages`` with timeout
0, ``markNotificationsAsRead: false``, and ``updateLastReadMessage`` never reached), which is a
sentence read out of somebody else's source code until it is measured here.

**Every id comes from a real search hit.** Not one ``fetch`` in this file is called with an id
this file made up. A guessed message id reads a neighbouring message and a guessed table id
reads a foreign table, and neither failure is loud (threats T-11-01, T-11-39). When the search
of this instance carries no hit of a kind, the measurement is a **skip with a true reason**, and
the reason names the terms that were tried.

**This file creates almost nothing.** No table, no message, no mail, no conversation: every
number below comes from what ``scripts/bootstrap_exapp.sh`` and the Nextcloud first run already
put there. The one exception is measurement 1b of plan 27-08, which writes one test file and
one test folder, tags them ``kein-ki`` through ``occ`` for its scenario B, and removes both
(and a tag it created) in a ``finally`` whose result it asserts. The one thing the other runs
could change is exactly what measurement 5 measures, and the last test of the file reads the
conversation counters once more so the end state is measured rather than assumed.

**A foreign provider error is not a failed leg.** The Deck comment provider of this instance
answers 500 every few runs, and the search leg passes that on as its own ``degraded`` entry,
which is what it is built to do. The assertions below are therefore about entries that say a
leg missed its budget, never about an empty ``degraded`` list, because an assertion on
emptiness would turn somebody else's flaky app into a red measurement of ours.

The topology this was measured against (six containers, three apps, one Nextcloud)::

    nc-mcp-exapp-nc  nc_app_mcp_connector  nc-mcp-exapp-harp
    nc-mcp-exapp-caddy  nc-mcp-exapp-registry  nc-mcp-exapp-greenmail
    Nextcloud 34.0.3, mail 5.11.1, spreed 24.0.4, tables 2.2.2

Run it against the running HaRP topology::

    docker compose -p nc-mcp-exapp -f compose.exapp.yml up -d --wait
    bash scripts/bootstrap_exapp.sh
    set -a && . ./.env.exapp && set +a
    uv run pytest tests/integration/test_ctx_bundle.py -m integration -s

The rows it prints with ``-s`` are the deliverable: they go into
``.planning/phases/11-b-ndelung-budget-und-release-0-1-6/11-06-MEASUREMENTS.md`` verbatim, and
the four budget comments in ``src/mcp_connector/tools/context.py`` quote them.

    The proof is a divergence: a conversation whose ``unread`` cannot be the number of messages

    the documented trap T12 (``unread == 1`` with an empty history). This instance does not
    carry that case right now, and it carries a stronger one instead: a conversation with
    several readable messages and ``unread == 0``. Both say the same thing, so the assertion is
    on the divergence and the trap case is checked additionally, when it is there.

    A divergence is only counted when one window of the history settles it, and the two
    directions settle differently. ``unread`` **below** the messages of the first window is
    proof on its own, because every further page can only add to that number. ``unread``
    **above** it is proof only when the answer carries no continuation, because otherwise the
    older pages could still make up the difference. ``truncated`` on this level does not mean
    "there is more to read": it means the app handed out a continuation id, which it does even
    for an empty window (see ``talk._messages``), so it cannot be used as a stand in for

    ``talk_browse(level="messages")`` is safe to use as the instrument here: its client sends
    ``READ_ONLY_PARAMS``, so ``setReadMarker`` and ``markNotificationsAsRead`` are both 0 and
    the reading cannot be what moves a counter.
