"""Unit tests for the ChatGPT profile tool ``fetch``, all eight id kinds and all failures.

``fetch`` is the one place in this server where a client supplied string decides which
resource is read, so the tests are written against that risk rather than against the happy
path. Every kind gets its own case, a wrong prefix has to be refused instead of guessed
(threat T-01-77), a ``url`` hit has to say out loud that it cannot be fetched instead of
inventing content (threat T-01-75), and a missing app has to produce the AppMissingError
sentence rather than a stack trace.

The Deck short form gets two tests of its own. One proves that the sweep finds a card whose
board and stack the search provider never reported, the other counts the HTTP calls: one
request per board and none per stack or per card, and the sweep stops at the board that
holds the card.

The mail block at the end of this file is written against a text that a stranger wrote. Its
most valuable case is the least spectacular one: a mail that was typed as plain text arrives
from the app as HTML, so the conversion is unconditional and a test proves that an umlaut
does not reach a model as ``&uuml;`` (correction K2 of the phase research). Beside it stand
the two refusals that must never become an empty success (a body that could not be decrypted
and a message that is nothing but attachments), the cut that carries a marker promising no
continuation, the trust signals that stay data fields and never turn into prose, and two
counting tests: one request on the full text route per ``fetch`` and none at all when the
Mail app is missing or the id is not a number.

The two blocks after it belong to the two kinds of phase 11, and both are written against the
one wrong answer nobody would see. For ``message:<token>:<messageId>`` that is a neighbour of
the wanted message: the context route answers a *window*, so the window here carries three
messages and the assertions name the two that must not appear. Beside it stand the two
refusals that must never become an empty success (the wanted message missing from the window,
and the empty window of a 304), the system message that is filtered rather than answered, the
placeholder resolution that ``{actor}`` proves, the token out of a model answer that never
reaches the context route, full retrieval beyond the browse preview, and explicit refusal
above the fetched-text budget. No server marker is inserted into a participant's text.

For ``table:<tableId>`` the wrong answer is a guessed table: one that carries no row, or one
whose header row is mistaken for content, would be answered with a title and nothing else. That
block pins the excerpt against its total (``rows_total`` beside ``rows_shown``, and both of them
in the text), the marker filter over a cell value, the byte ceiling with exactly one marker, and
two counting tests of its own: one request for the table, one for its rows, and none at all for
a URL that somebody wrote into a cell.
