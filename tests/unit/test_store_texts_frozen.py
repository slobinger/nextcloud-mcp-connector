"""Pin the App Store texts in appinfo/info.xml to their state of release 0.4.0.

EXCL-F02: the store texts (``summary`` and ``description`` in English, German
and French, the direct children of the root element ``info``) only travel to
the Nextcloud App Store with the next release. Phase 29 kept them byte-identical
to ca157b4; release 0.4.0 renewed the pin with the owner's decision of 2026-10-01
(the kein-ki bullet and Office and PDF in the tools bullet, in all three languages).

Why a hash instead of ``git show ca157b4:appinfo/info.xml``: the CI job
``unit`` checks out with depth 1, the reference commit is not available there.
The hash pins the extracted texts, so a comment or route added elsewhere in
info.xml does not trip the test, while any change to a store text does.

Renewing the pin is a deliberate act: only together with the owner's decision
on the store texts of the next release. Then recompute the hash with
``_store_texts`` on the new info.xml and update ``FROZEN_AT``,
``EXPECTED_SHA256`` and, if needed, ``EXPECTED_COUNT``.

The ten further ``description`` elements deeper in info.xml (route and option
descriptions) are not store texts and are deliberately not covered.
