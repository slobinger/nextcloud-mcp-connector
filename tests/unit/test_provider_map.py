"""Unit tests for the provider table and the id extraction of unified search entries.

Pitfall 10 in one sentence: a unified search entry has no ``id`` field, so every id in
this project is either read out of ``attributes`` (only Files fills it), parsed out of
``resourceUrl``, or honestly marked as not resolvable. These tests pin all three outcomes,
including the two that are easy to get wrong: an unknown provider must never be guessed
into a known kind, and a ``resourceUrl`` from a foreign host must never survive into the
answer (threat T-01-68).
