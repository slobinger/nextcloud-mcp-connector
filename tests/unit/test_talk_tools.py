"""Unit tests for the two Talk tools, all paths.

The three content traps of this phase are pinned here, because none of them is visible in a
happy path:

*   the conversation list is sorted **before** it is cut. The app builds its query without an
    ``ORDER BY``, so a cut without a sort answers with 50 arbitrary conversations instead of
    the 50 newest, and on a small instance that is invisible (T5). The fixture is deliberately
    unsorted and the test asserts the sequence of tokens, not the number of them.
*   the write pre-check reads the resolved ``permissions`` and not ``attendeePermissions``.
    The fixture carries a conversation with ``permissions`` 254 next to
    ``attendeePermissions`` 0, which is the ordinary case on any instance, and a regression to
    the raw field turns that test red with the reason in its name (T3).
*   type 4 is write protected although its ``readOnly`` flag says 0, and every account has
    exactly one of those (T4).

Everything else is the honest-failure catalogue of D-15 and SRV-04: a missing Talk app stops
both tools before the first Talk request, an empty ``spreed`` section behaves like a missing
one, an unknown level names both that exist, and the send path refuses six different ways
before a single byte leaves this process.
