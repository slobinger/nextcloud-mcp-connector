"""The operator pages of the kein-ki tag held against the code and the findings they cite.

Phase 29 writes one page per language (`docs/exclusion.md`, `docs/exclusion.de.md`,
`docs/exclusion.fr.md`) and one short section in each of the three READMEs (D-29-06,
D-29-07). Every sentence of those pages is a promise an administrator makes data protection
decisions on (T-29-24), so this module holds what can be held mechanically:

*   **The anchors.** The nine limits of D-29-05, the eight further technical limits of
    D-29-11 and four section anchors stand as ``<a id="...">`` in all three languages, with
    the same ids, because the French page and the READMEs of plan 29-08 link to them.
*   **The evidence.** Every limit section links at least one finding under
    ``../.planning/phases/``, the file it links exists, and the three limits measured in
    phase 25 (share boundary, invisible tag, app disabled) link the measuring report.
*   **The links.** Every relative link of a page resolves: files exist, anchors inside the
    page exist. The links of the language switcher are held by their own test and by the
    existence test of the sibling page, not here, so a page written before its sibling is
    not red for the sibling's absence.
*   **The names an operator types.** The command name, its two options, the ``passed`` key
    and the tag name come from the constants that define them, never typed a second time
    (T-29-26); the occ and WebDAV names of the setup (``tag:add``, ``tag:files:add``,
    ``oc:groups``, ``restrict_creation_to_admin``) are held as the strings the raw evidence
    of plan 29-01 ran.
*   **The exit code.** It is always 0 over AppAPI (D-29-04), and each page says so.
*   **The values the pages quote from this code** (29-REVIEW IN-05). The seven step ids,
    the step names and the limit sentence of the quoted output blocks, and the tag query
    budget ``TAG_BUDGET`` in seconds, all read off the constants, so a change of wording or
    of the budget turns this red until the pages follow.
*   **The typography.** No U+2013 and no U+2014 in the pages and the READMEs, and no ASCII
    stand-ins for umlauts in German prose (pitfall P6).
*   **The README sections.** Exactly one section per README links the page of its language,
    with three or four lines of text, naming the tag and the share boundary.

**What this module deliberately does not hold, and why.** The pages quote measured numbers
of somebody else's software: the roughly 240 seconds of a REPORT on SQLite with 140,000
assignments, the menu path of the Nextcloud settings, the wording of occ output. They are
true because a measurement with a date says so (25-MESSBERICHT.md, raw/29-01-messungen.txt,
raw/29-06-live-beweis.txt), not because this code says so, and a constant invented here to
anchor them would turn a measurement into a fiction that a later reader trusts more than the
measurement. They stay held by their date and their source link in the page. This module is
also not a vocabulary gate; it checks whether the pages are true and complete, not how well
they read.
