# registers a manual-install daemon and the app with a fixed secret and a fixed port, so a

# The public staging instance of plan 03-09:
#
#   bash scripts/bootstrap_exapp.sh --staging
#
# does the same work against compose.staging.yml instead of compose.exapp.yml: the public
# host name from NC_STAGING_DOMAIN becomes the base of NC_MCP_PUBLIC_URL, the connection
# file is .env.staging.app, and the bruteforce guard stays on, because that instance is
# reachable from the internet. It is a flag and not an environment variable on purpose,
# for the same reason COMPOSE_FILE is not overridable (WR-07): a forgotten export in a
# shell must never be able to redirect this script at a topology the caller did not mean.
# scripts/setup_staging.sh is the only intended caller; docs/staging-setup.md is the
# runbook around it.

#   bash scripts/bootstrap_exapp.sh --nc35
#
# does the same work against compose.nc35.yml on port 8082, so the 34 topology keeps
# running untouched next to it. It is a flag for the same reason --staging is one: the
# first version of this was a copy of this file with two constants changed, and the three
# it did not change (the port, the HaRP container and the network) made it create accounts
# in the 34 instance while asserting against the 35 one, which looked like a product defect
# for an hour.
#
# This script only ever talks to one of the two throwaway topologies named above. It never

# --- the third data layer: a read-only share (plan 05-03) ---------------------------
#
# alice and bob alone can only prove a leak: bob does not see what alice has. Success
# criterion 3 of this phase also asks what bob DOES see, and where Nextcloud stops him
# anyway, and both need an asymmetry that lives in the data rather than in the comparison
# (05-RESEARCH.md, pitfall 6):
#
#   * a folder of alice, shared with bob read-only, with one marked file in it, and
#   * a second marked file of alice that is never shared with anybody.
#
# Then five statements are measurable and none of them is a tautology: bob finds the shared
# file, he does not find the private one, he reads the shared one, he cannot write into the
# read-only folder although our upload tool is create-only, and a second upload on a path
# that exists is refused. The fourth is where permission parity and the create-only promise
# meet at a boundary Nextcloud draws and we do not.
#
# Everything below is created over WebDAV and OCS with alice's own account password, never
# by writing into the data directory the way ensure_files_home has to: a file placed there
# carries no file id until the next files:scan, and a folder without a file id cannot be
# shared at all.

# The unique suffix every name of the fixture carries, pinned across runs exactly like
# APP_SECRET and for a comparable reason: a fresh suffix on a second run would leave the
# instance with a second folder and a second share, and the test would then measure whichever
# of them the current .env.exapp happens to name. Ten hex characters, so a marker can never
# collide with the neutral skeleton file ensure_files_home leaves behind.

# --- the Talk test conversations (plan 09-05) -----------------------------------------

# Two conversations of alice, both with real umlauts in the name: one writable and one write
# protected. The write protected one carries the negative case of TALK-03, because a refusal
# with a sentence and a next step needs an object to be refused on and not an assumption.
#
# The changelog conversation (type 4) is deliberately not created and never used as a target.
# Talk creates it for every account by itself, it is always write protected, and it is exactly
# the trap `tools.talk._may_send` catches.
#
# `occ talk:room:create` is **not** idempotent: a second call creates a second room with the
# same name. The room is therefore looked up by name first and only created when it is
# missing. The lookup goes over the conversation list of the account itself, because the app
# ships no listing command at all: measured against spreed 24.0.4 on 2026-08-21, the `talk:`
# namespace offers create, update, delete, add, remove, promote and demote, and nothing that
# lists rooms.
#
# The name is matched on its ASCII prefix and not on the whole string, and that is not
# laziness: PHP writes every umlaut of a JSON answer as a \uXXXX escape, so a grep for the
# literal name would never match the answer of the API. The prefix is unique per

# The registration overrides exactly three fields of the manifest: registry, image and

# (D-25 publishes nothing before phase 5), while the local test needs an image that
# actually exists, and that one lives in the loopback registry.
#
# The four backslashes in each well-known route are two levels of escaping: the unquoted
# heredoc consumes one pair, and JSON needs the remaining one so the route regex reaches
# AppAPI as ^/\.well-known/... with an escaped dot. Two backslashes here produce the
# invalid JSON escape \. and AppAPI answers "Invalid app info provided in JSON format".
# Every pattern ends with $, and every route is access level 0 (PUBLIC): HaRP matches with
# re.match, the 401 of the OAuth discovery flow has to come from the ExApp itself, and the
# browser onboarding of plan 03-04 is used by a person who is not necessarily signed in to
# Nextcloud yet. The four routes of the authorization server (plan 03-05) are public for
# their own reasons: /authorize is a browser route and HaRP knows no sign in redirect, and
# /token, /register and /revoke carry their own controls and no user session at all. The
# connections page of plan 04-03 is the thirteenth and is public for the reason its own
# manifest comment gives: the identity check happens in the app
# (appinfo/info.xml carries the full reasoning, plans 03-01, 03-04, 03-05 and 04-03).
#
# headers_to_exclude mirrors appinfo/info.xml: the proxy strips the headers it sets itself,
# so a client cannot send a second AUTHORIZATION-APP-API next to the real one (WR-01).
#
# Daemon and port are parameters, so the development loop builds its payload the same way
# instead of rewriting this one with sed.
# The one deploy option this topology sets, and it is not cosmetic: the authorization
# server calls itself by NC_MCP_PUBLIC_URL, so without it every discovery document, every
# issuer and every resource_metadata pointer names the documented default
# http://127.0.0.1:8765 and no client can complete a connection (measured in plan 03-08).
#
# It travels in the payload and not as `--env`, because the two registration paths of
# AppAPI are not equivalent: the info.xml path normalises
# external-app/environment-variables into the map the deploy daemon reads and lets `--env`
# override a declared variable, while the json-info path hands the decoded object through
# untouched (ExAppService::getAppInfo, verified in the running AppAPI 34.0.0). So the
# already normalised shape is what a json-info registration has to carry, and `--env`
# alone is accepted and silently dropped. appinfo/info.xml declares the same six
# variables for the installation that registers from the manifest.

#
# Then install it by hand once and let the script enable it:

#   1. Download the release archive on a machine that has access:
#      https://github.com/nextcloud/app_api/releases (pick the tag that matches the
#      server version of the running image: 34.x for the default of compose.exapp.yml,
#      35.x when NC_EXAPP_NEXTCLOUD_IMAGE points at a 35 image).
#   2. Unpack it into the container so the app directory keeps its plain name:
#        docker compose -f compose.exapp.yml cp app_api nextcloud:/var/www/html/custom_apps/app_api
#        docker compose -f compose.exapp.yml exec -T --user root nextcloud \
#          chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/custom_apps/app_api
#   3. Re-run this script: `occ app:install` still fails, `occ app:enable` now succeeds.
#
# FALLBACK 2: the app answers 401 after a re-registration (research pitfall 11)
#
# APP_SECRET is generated fresh on every registration unless the registration carries one.
# This script pins it: the value from .env.exapp is passed in the json-info payload, so a
# re-registration keeps the secret stable. If .env.exapp was deleted, a new secret is
# generated, and then everything that still holds the old one has to be restarted:
#
#   docker compose -f compose.exapp.yml exec -T --user www-data nextcloud \
#     php occ app_api:app:unregister mcp_connector
