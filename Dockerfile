# ExApp container image for the AppAPI deploy daemon (EXAPP-01, D-25).
#
# Two stages, because uv and the build tool chain have no business in a published image:
# the build stage resolves the locked environment, the runtime stage carries that
# environment plus curl and frpc, and nothing else.
#
# There is no EXPOSE. AppAPI passes APP_PORT to the container at start time, and behind
# HaRP there is no TCP port at all (unix socket plus frpc tunnel), so an EXPOSE would only
# document a number this image cannot know.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Build stage: resolve the locked dependency set
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Pinned by digest for the same reason the uv line below pins a release: the tag
# 3.13-slim moves, the digest does not, and dependabot's docker pass moves the digest
# deliberately instead of a rebuild moving it silently. The digest is the multi-arch
# index, so amd64 and arm64 both resolve under it.

# A pinned uv release from the official image instead of a curl-pipe-shell installer: the
# image tag is what resolves the dependency set, and a moving "latest" would make the
# build irreproducible (T-02-24).
